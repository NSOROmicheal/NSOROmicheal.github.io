💻 NSORO MICHEAL — The Light King of Code
Legacy of a Developer Born from Silence, Raised by Purpose
I wasn’t born in a place—I was born in a storm.
Not in comfort, but in complexity.
My father was young, my mother still a student, both caught in the struggle of survival.
So they made a choice: to send me to Nyagatare,
where my grandparents raised me, and Aunt Rose became the mother I thought I had.
My real mother had gone to Uganda.
I was too young to understand, too quiet to ask.
Later, my uncle brought me to Kigali. We lived together, until silence became my roommate.
Four years alone in a house—no guidance, no noise, just me and the machine.
That’s when I met code.
Not in a classroom. Not in a lab.
But in the quiet, where most people break—I built.
While others chased comfort, I chased logic.
While the world gave me chaos, I wrote structure.
My uncle married. The house changed.
I became the invisible one. Suspected. Misunderstood.
But I didn’t fight—I built.
I built systems, not arguments.
I built solutions, not excuses.

🌍 When the Earth Fights You
There are moments when no one listens.
When the world seems to rise against you.
But I learned to rise with it.
Not with noise—but with code.

Not with revenge—but with resilience.

🚀 Legacy in Motion
Today, I build more than software.
I build bridges—for those who feel unheard.
I build tools—for those who live in silence.
I build NSORO & MICHEAL Studios—not just as a brand,
but as a kingdom of light born from digital shadows.
I wasn’t born to be seen.
I was born to create what others will see.

Not with revenge—but with resilience.
